Socket.IO Integration: Implements Socket.IO for real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication between the client and server.
EJS Templating: Uses EJS as the view engine to render dynamic HTML content.
Static File Serving: Serves static files from the public directory, enabling easy access to stylesheets, scripts, and images.
Simple Route Handling: Demonstrates basic route handling by responding with a text message at the root URL.
